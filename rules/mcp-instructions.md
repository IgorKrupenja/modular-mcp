# MCP Rules Server Integration

`modular-mcp` server is available to provide AI coding assistant rules for different tech stacks, projects, and languages.

## When to Load Rules

Load rules from MCP when the user asks for:

- Tech-specific rules (e.g., "Get NestJS rules", "Load React rules")
- Project-specific rules (e.g., "Load Service-Module rules")
- Language-specific rules (e.g., "Get TypeScript rules")
- Discovery (e.g., "What projects are available?", "Show available tech stacks")

**Important:** When loading rules, add them to the conversation context for reference. Do NOT save them as files in `.cursor/rules/` or anywhere else - they are temporary context, not project files.

## Available MCP Resources

### Rules Resource: `rules://{scope}/{id}`

Use MCP resources to load rules directly into context. The resource URI format is:

- `rules://tech/{tech-id}` - Technology rules (e.g., nestjs, react, spring)
- `rules://language/{language-id}` - Language rules (e.g., typescript, java)
- `rules://project/{project-id}` - Project-specific rules (e.g., buerokratt/Service-Module)

**When the exact ID is unclear or user asks for available options:**
Use the `list_scope_ids` tool to discover what's available for that scope before loading.

## Available MCP Tools

1. **list_scope_ids** - List available IDs for a scope
   - Parameters: `scope` (project/group/tech/language)
   - Use when: User asks "What projects are available?" or "Show available technologies"

2. **search_rules** - Search rules by keyword
   - Parameters: `keyword` (required), `scope` (optional), `id` (optional)
   - Use when: User asks "Find rules about testing" or "Search for database rules"

3. **get_mcp_instructions** - Get detailed instructions on how to use this MCP server
   - No parameters required
   - Use when: You need guidance on how to use this MCP server effectively

## How to Respond to User Requests

### General Strategy

1. **If the exact scope/id is clear** → Load the resource directly (most efficient)
2. **If the scope/id is unclear or ambiguous** → Use `list_scope_ids` first to discover available options
3. **If user explicitly asks for discovery** → Use `list_scope_ids` or `search_rules`

### Examples

User says: "Get NestJS rules" or "Load NestJS rules"

- Scope is clear (tech), ID is clear (nestjs)
- → Load resource `rules://tech/nestjs` from MCP

User says: "Load rules for this project"

- Scope is clear (project), but ID is NOT clear
- → First use `list_scope_ids` with scope "project" to see available projects
- → Then ask user which project or infer from context (e.g., current file path)

User says: "What technologies are available?"

- Explicit discovery request
- → Use `list_scope_ids` tool with scope "tech"

User says: "Show available projects"

- Explicit discovery request
- → Use `list_scope_ids` tool with scope "project"

User says: "Find rules about testing"

- Search across all rules
- → Use `search_rules` tool with keyword "testing"

User says: "Get React and NestJS rules for this full-stack project"

- Both scopes and IDs are clear
- → Load resources `rules://tech/react` and `rules://tech/nestjs` from MCP

## Important Notes

- **Always prefer resource URIs** (`rules://...`) over tools when loading rules - they're more efficient
- **Rules stay in context** once loaded - user can ask follow-up questions
- **Resource IDs are case-sensitive** - use exact IDs as shown above
- **Only load when explicitly asked** - don't load rules preemptively
- **NEVER save loaded rules as files** - Rules from MCP should be kept in conversation context only, NOT written to `.cursor/rules/` or any other files. They are dynamically loaded content, not project files.
